sequence.rb's goals are to encapsulate a single sequence in a memory efficient
manner.

Well, first lets just get it providing useful methods.  We can worry about
memory usage when/if it becomes a problem.

We'll need some way to keep alignments represented?  IE, quality scores should
be aligned as well.

Do we want a seperate alignment class maybe?  Or chain things?  Hrm..
Lets keep it simple for now.  We can add complexity when we need it.
